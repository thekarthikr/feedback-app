# Feedback App

This Feedback app is a React.js based web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete their feedback. The feedback is stored using a JSON server, which means that all changes made by the user will be updated in real-time on the server. This app was built using the Vite bundler for optimal performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running the following command:

  `npm install`

4. To start the development server

  `npm run dev`

5. To start the JSON server

  `npm run server`

6. To start the development server and the JSON server, run the following command:

  `npm run start`


This command will start both the React development server and the JSON server concurrently, which means that you can develop and test your app in real-time with the data stored in the JSON server.

5. The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

  `npm run build`


This will create a production-ready build of the app in the `dist` directory.
